# Nine-Men-Morris

Nine men's morris is a two player strategy board game dating back to at least the Roman Empire.

The board consists of a grid with twenty-four intersections or points. Each player has nine pieces, or "men", usually coloured black and white. Players try to form 'mills'—three of their own men lined horizontally or vertically—allowing a player to remove an opponent's man from the game. A player wins by reducing the opponent to two pieces (where they could no longer form mills and thus be unable to win), or by leaving them without a legal move.

The game proceeds in three phases:
1. Placing men on vacant points
2. Moving men to adjacent points
3. (optional phase) Moving men to any vacant point when the player has been reduced to three men

Our Nine Mens Morris game can be played in two ways. The first way is to play a human vs AI game. The second way is to watch a AI vs AI game. For the AI vs AI game we use two different heuristics. You can set the heuristics you use through the code.

The difficulty level of the game can also be changed by changing the heuristic function in the code.

To run the game type: python3 main.py in a terminal

Working for python 3.5.2
